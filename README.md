# structLib

structLib is essentially a module which contains the _Struct_ class. This class is specifically
aimed at making your life easier when working with JSON-like objects (meaning nested
_dict_ / _list_ objects)

## Installation

To install structLib on your python setup, run the following:
```python
pip install structLib
```
On linux or mac you will probably need to run this command instead:
```python
python3 -m pip install structLib
```
Please note that version 3.8 (or higher) of python is required to run this library!
